This program is new and in state "Work in Progress".  The apps I have
created work but the software is in no way "stable".

I used data from www.eoddata.com that is free.

I have used TA-Lib (ta-lib.org) but the plan is that any library can be used
if it meets the processing interface specification.  I have
also wrote some of my own metric calculations.

If you are interested in working on this project or have questions then send
an email to askeyaj@gmail.com.
