This program is new and in state "Work in Progress".  The apps I have
created work but the software is in no way "stable".

I used data from www.eoddata.com that is free.

The application AppTemplate in net.ajaskey.market.ta.apps is a good place 
to learn how to use the data input within this project.  The other apps
provide some ways of processing the input data.

If you are interested in working on this project or have questions then send
an email to andy@andysmarketmusings.net.

Examples of some of the outputs generated can be found here:
